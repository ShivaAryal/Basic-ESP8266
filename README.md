how to use esp8266 for fetching data from a local server

I am using a Nodemcu 1.0 esp8266 module for the project. It can directly be programmed by a USB cable from arduino IDE. The I/O pins are 
connected to the respective leds or anything(i have used led for the project). The localhost link must contain a json file structure for 
the working of the project i have done here but data can be fetched with many other methods too.
